Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a branch in Computer Science that deals with the design, developing, testing and maintaining software.
Its importance is to: develop reliable, efficient and flexible software applications.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Masstering the machine- software was used to optimize exploitation of limited hardware resources.
Mastering the process- to reduce risk during development and improve productivity and quality.
Mastering the complexity- enables efficient reuse of object-oriented software hence improving software productivity.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning- identifying the purpose of the software.
Requirement Analysis- identifying the specific final user.
Design- building the framework.
Coding- converting the design to code.
Testing- examining the software for bugs.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology- has low flexibility, testing is done at the end of the development, each phase is completed before moving to the next.
Agile methodology- has high flexibility, testing is continuous and done after each phase, involves many cycles.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A software developer develops applications, maintains software to keep its functionality, works with other team memebers to ensure the project runs well. 
A quality assurance engineer verifies that the software meets the threshold, checks for bugs, creates procedures for programmers to follow.
A project manager is responsible for assembling the software team, tracks the progress of the project, delivers the complete software to the client.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs are software platforms used to create other software applications. They convert code into simpler language that can be understood by the operating system.
VCS is a tool that helps software teams manage changes to source code over time. It records detailed history of changes over time.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Software security. Software engineers are often faced by security threats such as hacking and phishing. To overcome this, they shouldn't click on just any links especially from senders they are unaware of.
Time factor. Software engineers find themselves faced with limited time to meet deadlines. They can divide the work into portions, allocating each adequate time depending on how long they have.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing- this is testing individual components used by the software. It ensures each unit performs correctly and as it should.
Integration testing- tests that different modules on the software work together. This ensures data flows smoothly between the modules.
System testing- tests the functionality of the software as a whole. This ensures the system meets all requirements including performance and security.
Acceptance testing- tests that a system meets business requirements. This ensures the system is ready for deployment to the final user.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering refers to guiding generative AI solutions to generate desired output. This makes users have a smooth process as they get right results within the first prompt.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt- generate a food recipe.
Clear, specific, concise- generate a recipe on how I can prepare crispy chicken that is golden brown with these ingredients: paprika, black pepper, garlic, coriander, oil, salt, flour, eggs, breadcrumbs
The improved prompt is more effective as it narrows down to the specifics of the result I desire to achieve
